# Project Ol√° Mundo

This is a project from Alura that I undertook to enhance my knowledge of JavaScript. Additionally, it covered other important topics, such as:
<ul>
  <li>Organizing folders and files in your project</li>
  <li>Implementing User Interface components</li>
  <li>Handling static files in a React project</li>
  <li>Advantages of using CSS modules and Sass</li>
  <li>JavaScript methods to add functionality to the page</li>
  <li>Nested and dynamic routes</li>
</ul>
